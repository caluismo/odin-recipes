# Odin Project Recipes

This is a project guided by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
Itâ€™s a simple website built with basic **HTML** that showcases a few recipes. 

The goal of this project is to practice working with HTML structure, lists, links, and images, while also learning how to set up and manage a project with Git and GitHub.
