        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Birria tacos are a rich, flavorful Mexican dish made with slow-cooked beef braised in a chili sauce until tender and shredded. The tortillas are dipped in the savory consommé, pan-fried until crispy, then filled with juicy beef and melted cheese. Served with onions, cilantro, lime, and extra consommé for dipping, these tacos are bold, cheesy, and irresistible.</p>
